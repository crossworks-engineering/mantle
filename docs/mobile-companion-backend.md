# Mobile Companion — backend additions

_Last updated: 2026-06-13._

API + schema added to Mantle to support the **Mantle Companion** mobile app
(Flutter; repo `~/Projects/mantle-companion`). Single-user/self-hosted, so the
only auth scope is the owner. Everything here is **owner-gated via
`requireOwner()`**, which accepts the session cookie *or* a mobile bearer token —
so each route works unchanged from web and mobile.

> Status: **DEPLOYED TO PROD (2026-06-14, v0.24.0).** Migrations 0089/0090/0091
> applied on prod (drizzle count 89 → 92) via the gated `migrate` one-shot; data
> intact (nodes unchanged). All routes live behind the owner-gate: a no-token
> request 307s to /login (edge middleware), an invalid-bearer request gets a clean
> **401** from `getOwnerOr401`, and `mobile-login` 401s bad creds. Pre-migration
> brain dump taken first (`backups/mantle-20260614-172127.dump`).
>
> Previously: smoke-tested end-to-end on local dev (2026-06-13) — all four route
> groups verified with a mobile bearer; the avatar route needed a fix (see its
> section).

## Auth — per-device bearer tokens

- `packages/db/src/schema/mobile-tokens.ts` + migration `0090_…`'s predecessor
  `0089_mobile_tokens.sql` — `mobile_tokens` table (revocable, expiry).
- `apps/web/lib/auth.ts` — `buildMobileToken` / `verifyMobileToken` /
  `mobileTokenJti` / `getBearerUser`; `getSessionUser()` falls back to
  `Authorization: Bearer`.
- `apps/web/middleware.ts` — accepts a valid mobile bearer (stateless verify),
  401s a malformed one (wrapped in try/catch).
- Routes: `POST /api/auth/mobile-login` `{email, password, deviceName}` →
  `{token, expiresIn}`; `POST /api/auth/mobile-logout` (revokes by `jti`).
- **Client contract:** a revoked/expired token still passes the stateless Edge
  gate (revocation is enforced in the Node layer). The JSON API routes below gate
  with **`getOwnerOr401()`**, which returns a clean **401 `{error:'unauthorized'}`**
  in that case — not a redirect. (HTML *page* routes still use `requireOwner()` →
  **307 → /login**.) The app treats **401 OR 3xx→/login** as "session invalid".
- **`getOwnerOr401()`** (`lib/auth.ts`) is the gate for programmatic JSON routes:
  it returns `SessionUser | NextResponse`, so the handler does
  `const owner = await getOwnerOr401(); if (owner instanceof NextResponse) return owner;`.
  Used by dashboard-summary, conversations, read, and avatar.

## Dashboard summary

- `GET /api/dashboard/summary` (`app/api/dashboard/summary/route.ts`) — mirrors the
  web dashboard KPIs by composing existing `lib/dashboard.ts` / `lib/metrics.ts`
  functions: `{ spend: {last7MicroUsd, prior7MicroUsd}, brain: {nodesTotal,
  entitiesTotal, edgesTotal, factsTotal}, vectors: {vectorsTotal, …}, pendingCount }`.
  Spend is **micro-USD** (÷1e6). System vitals come from the existing `/api/health`.

## Conversations inbox + read state

- Schema `packages/db/src/schema/assistant-read-cursors.ts` + migration
  `0090_assistant_read_cursors.sql` — `assistant_read_cursors(owner_id, agent_id,
  last_read_at)` (composite PK, FK → agents). Mantle had **no** read/unread concept
  before this.
- `apps/web/lib/assistant-inbox.ts` — `getReadCursors`, `markAssistantRead`
  (upsert), `assistantConversations` (per chat-capable agent: latest message
  preview + `unreadCount` = outbound messages newer than the cursor; sorted by
  recency).
- `GET /api/assistant/conversations` → `{ conversations: [{ agentId, slug, name,
  avatar, lastMessage: {text, direction, createdAt} | null, unreadCount }] }`.
- `POST /api/assistant/read` `{ agentSlug?, at? }` — marks an agent's thread read
  (clears unread). Omitting `agentSlug` marks the default agent. Body is
  `safeParse`d → **400 `{error:'invalid_body'}`** on a malformed/mistyped body
  (not a 500); unknown agent → 404.

## Live chat (SSE)

- **`GET /api/assistant/stream`** (`app/api/assistant/stream/route.ts`) — a
  per-owner Server-Sent Events stream. Each turn (any channel) emits
  `data: {agentSlug, direction}`; the client refetches that thread + the inbox on
  receipt (the same "ping-to-refetch" model as `/api/realtime`). Heartbeat
  comment every 25s. Owner-gated with `getOwnerOr401` → clean 401 before the
  stream opens. Mirrors `/api/realtime` exactly (verified byte-identical
  `: connected` framing).
- **Migration `0091_conversation_changed_notify.sql`** — an `AFTER INSERT` trigger
  on `assistant_messages` that `pg_notify('conversation_changed', …)` with a JSON
  payload `{ownerId, agentSlug, direction}` (the slug via an indexed PK subquery
  on `agents`, so the client needs no id→slug lookup). Distinct from the existing
  `summarize_due` trigger (agent-id only, drives summarization).
- **`lib/realtime.ts`** gained a `conversation_changed` LISTEN on its shared
  bridge connection + `subscribeConversations()` (parallel to `subscribeRealtime`).
  Since `assistant_messages` aren't `nodes`, they don't flow through the existing
  `node_ingested` path — this is a separate channel on the same bridge.
- Verified live: trigger→NOTIFY→bridge→subscriber delivers `{ownerId, agentSlug,
  direction}` end-to-end (fresh-eval). Note: a *running* dev server's bridge is a
  `globalThis` singleton that survives HMR, so a newly-added LISTEN needs a server
  restart to register — a dev-only artifact; prod evaluates the module once.

## Agent avatar image

- `GET /api/agents/[id]/avatar?size=` (`app/api/agents/[id]/avatar/route.ts`) —
  server-renders the agent's boring-avatars SVG so non-web clients can show the
  same avatar. `runtime = 'nodejs'`. Returns `image/svg+xml`; **404** when the
  agent has no `avatar` (client falls back to initials). The key resolves as a
  **uuid when it looks like one, else as a slug** — so the companion's
  `/api/agents/<slug>/avatar` calls work unchanged.
- Palette is the **hex** Clean-Slate chart ramp (`#6366F1 …`), not the theme's
  oklch tokens, because SVG consumers like `flutter_svg` can't parse `oklch()`.
- **Two gotchas hit (and fixed) during smoke-testing:**
  1. **Segment-name conflict.** The route was first added at `[slug]/avatar`, but
     `agents/[id]/…` already exists. Next forbids two different dynamic slug names
     at one level and silently 404s *both*. Fix: nest under the existing `[id]`.
  2. **`react-dom/server` can't render the boring-avatars component here.** It
     calls `useId()`, and in a Next route the bundled React runtime and an
     imported `react-dom/server` are **two different React instances**, so the
     hook dispatcher is null → `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useId')`.
     Fix: **`lib/avatar-svg.ts`**, a pure-string port of boring-avatars v2 (no
     React, no hooks; works in any runtime). Byte-for-byte colour+geometry parity
     with the library is pinned by `lib/avatar-svg.test.ts` (every variant × 8
     seeds) so it can't drift on a `boring-avatars` upgrade.

## Migrations

The repo hand-writes migrations (drizzle-kit snapshots collide). Added:
`0089_mobile_tokens.sql`, `0090_assistant_read_cursors.sql`, each with a
`meta/_journal.json` entry. Apply with `pnpm db:migrate`. **0089–0091 applied on
prod (2026-06-14, v0.24.0);** `assistant_read_cursors` verified: composite PK
`(owner_id, agent_id)`, `last_read_at timestamptz default now()`, FK →
`agents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.

## Push notifications (M2)

`0092_push.sql` + `lib/push/*` + `workers/push-notify.ts` (Mantle v0.25.0) add the
backend half of **Mantle Push**: owner-gated `POST /api/push/connect` (lazily
generates this install's instance token, registers it with the relay, mints an
enrollment ticket), `POST|GET /api/push/subscriptions`, `DELETE
/api/push/subscriptions/:id`, `POST /api/push/reset`; and `worker_push`, which
LISTENs `conversation_changed` (migration 0091) and forwards each outbound turn's
**libsodium-sealed** teaser to the relay's `/notify`. Full design +
relay/app halves: `../../mantle-companion/docs/push-notifications.md`. The relay
is live at `https://push.crossworks.network` (mock provider until APNs/FCM creds).
