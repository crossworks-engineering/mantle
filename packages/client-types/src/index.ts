/**
 * @mantle/client-types — wire-shape (JSON) types for the HTTP API, shared by the
 * client components that consume `/api/**` (TanStack Query) and the server code
 * that produces the responses.
 *
 * Pure types: ZERO runtime, ZERO dependencies. That's the whole point — a client
 * component can name a row shape without importing `@mantle/db` (which drags
 * `postgres` into the browser bundle). This is the single source of truth for the
 * frontend/backend contract as screens move to client data-fetching (Phase 2 ·
 * Task 4); the server aliases its summary types to these so drift is a type error.
 *
 * Dates are ISO strings here — that's how they cross the wire (JSON has no Date).
