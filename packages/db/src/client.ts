 * calls getDb() on every property access, so without a cache each access would
 * mint a fresh `postgres()` pool (max: 10) and leak connections without bound.
 * The cache used to be gated behind `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (the usual
 * Next.js survive-HMR-in-dev idiom) — but that inverted the logic: in
 * production nothing was cached, so every query opened a new pool and the
 * long-lived workers/agent exhausted Postgres within seconds. Cache always;
 * globalThis is process-global, so one pool per process is exactly right.

 * once the work is done the event loop still has a live handle and node never
 * exits. That failure is silent and expensive — the app-db and table-workbook
 * backup scripts finished their snapshots, printed their summary, then hung
 * forever; `db-dump.sh` runs `snapshot && tar` inside ONE `docker exec`, so the
 * tar was never reached and every archive landed 0 bytes while the run looked
 * clean. Any script that touches `db` and is expected to terminate needs this.
